# Skyrim-Alchemy-Calculator-and-Database
A program that streamlines the process of making potions in TES V: Skyrim.
Using SACD is much faster and easier than looking over spreadsheets or scrolling through the wiki.

With SACD, you can:
1. Search ingredients to get an overview of their effects and what they can be combined with
2. Search any number of effects to get a list of ingredients with those effects
3. Find out what potions you can make by simply typing in the ingredients you have
